 * Serve another resource's built files, in dev only.
 *
 * A script can ship its own React component for the panel to render, loaded
 * in game from `nui://<resource>/<path>`. A browser has no such scheme, so in
 * dev those pages could not be opened at all - which meant they could not be
 * looked at, worked on, or screenshotted for the docs.
 *
 * Resources are siblings of lsx_lib on disk, so the file is simply read from
 * there. Dev only: the real panel uses nui:// and never touches this.
