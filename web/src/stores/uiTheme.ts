/**
 * Which colours each shared UI element is currently wearing.
 *
 * ── why a store rather than a prop ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The theme arrives in the element's own NUI payload, so the obvious thing is
 * for the component to wrap its own return in `<Themed>`. That does not work,
 * and it fails QUIETLY: a component resolves its hooks in its BODY, which is
 * outside the JSX it returns. So `useMantineTheme()` up there still answers
 * with lsx_lib's palette and every colour computed from it comes out wrong,
 * while the markup underneath looks right. Half-themed, no error.
 *
 * Restructuring ten components so nothing reads the theme above its own return
 * is a lot of surgery to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * So the theme is lifted out instead. Each component reports what it was sent;
 * `App` wraps the component ITSELF in `<Themed>`. The whole component — body,
 * hooks and all — is then inside the scope, and no component has to be
 * restructured or even know this exists beyond one line.
