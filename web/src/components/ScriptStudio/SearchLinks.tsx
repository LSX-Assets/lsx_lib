/**
 * "It's over here" — results the pane in front of you cannot show.
 *
 * ── the gap this fills ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Searching inside a script filters the SCROLLING sections in place, which
 * works for ordinary settings and cannot work for a workspace — a map, a list
 * editor. Those are not in the scroll; they replace it, one at a time, opened
 * from the rail. So a match inside one had nowhere to appear: the rail lit up,
 * the pane showed nothing about it, and you had to click the section and then
 * find the tab yourself.
 *
 * The cross-script results list already knew how to link somewhere. It just
 * never rendered while the current script had any other match, which is most of
 * the time.
 *
 * So these are cards, above the filtered pane rather than instead of it. They
 * name the thing that matched — the yard, the store, the fish, by ITS name, not
 * the setting's — say which section and tab it is on, and take you there.
