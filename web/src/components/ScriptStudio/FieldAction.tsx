/**
 * A button beside a setting that DOES something.
 *
 * The sibling of `x-validateWith`, and deliberately not the same thing.
 * Validation asks passively whether a value looks usable, on every debounced
 * keystroke. An action has an effect out in the world: "Test webhook" posts a
 * real message into a real Discord channel, and doing that while someone types
 * a URL would fill the channel with test messages.
 *
 * So it happens when asked. What it means is entirely the owning script's
 * business - lsx_lib sends the request, and reports whatever comes back.
