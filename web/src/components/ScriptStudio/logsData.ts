 * The Logs page, reading the server's own log table.

 * Three queries, deliberately separate, because they are asked for at very
 * different rates:
 *
 *   * ROWS are paged as you scroll, by keyset - the cursor is the last id
 *     seen, so a page cannot skip or repeat a line when new ones arrive
 *     underneath, which offset paging does constantly on a table being
 *     written to.
 *   * FACETS - which resources and events exist - change slowly and are the
 *     expensive query (a GROUP BY over the window). Cached hard on both sides:
 *     a minute on the server, five here.
 *   * HEALTH - row count and size - is a footnote, and read from
 *     information_schema rather than counted.
 *
 * Nothing polls. A log page that refetches on a timer is a page that costs
 * something while nobody is looking at it.
