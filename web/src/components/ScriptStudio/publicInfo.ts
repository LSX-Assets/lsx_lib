 * What is going on outside this server.

 * A script ships with its own CHANGELOG.md, and that file can only ever
 * describe the build it shipped in - it cannot know about a release that came
 * after it. This is the part that can: a small public repo holding the
 * announcement feed, the current version of each script, and a copy of each
 * changelog.
 *
 * Fetched by the PANEL, not by the server.
 *
 * The server has no business making outbound requests on a customer's behalf,
 * and a boot-time fetch would have meant every server that runs a LSX script
 * calling home whether anyone ever opened the panel or not. An admin opening
 * the panel is the moment this information is wanted, and it is their machine
 * that asks for it. Nothing about the server leaves the server.
 *
 * Everything here fails quietly. This is a nicety on top of a settings panel:
 * if GitHub is unreachable, or a firewall blocks it, the panel works exactly
 * as it did before and simply has nothing to announce.
