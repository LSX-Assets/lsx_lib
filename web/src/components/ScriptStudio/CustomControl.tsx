/**
 * A control the OWNING SCRIPT supplies, rendered inline in its section.
 *
 * Built-in controls cover the shapes every script shares. Some things are only
 * meaningful to one script — example_phone's places want the phone's own map, with
 * its categories and its pins — and until now there was nowhere for those to
 * go. The alternative was per-script components inside lsx_lib, which is the
 * one thing this design refuses.
 *
 * The Studio is lsx_lib's bundle, so it cannot bundle another resource's
 * component. It can IMPORT one at runtime: `nui://<resource>/<path>` is the
 * same scheme the panel already uses for item images out of ox_inventory, so
 * this is an ordinary dynamic import rather than anything clever.
 *
 * The component builds with React, Mantine and the rest marked external and
 * mapped to `window.__lsxStudio.*`, so it ships as a small file that shares
 * the panel's own React - two copies of React in one page would break hooks.
 *
 * Declared as:
 *   "places": { "x-component": "web/build/studio/places-map.js" }
 *
 * The file default-exports a component taking `{ value, onChange, canEdit }` -
 * the same props ZoneMap already takes per layer.
