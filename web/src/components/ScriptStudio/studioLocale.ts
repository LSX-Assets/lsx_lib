/**
 * Setting labels belong to the SCRIPT, not to lsx_lib.
 *
 * The hub renders every script's settings, but the words describing them ship
 * with the script that owns them - otherwise adding a setting to fishing would
 * need a lsx_lib locale update, and lsx_lib's locale file would slowly become
 * a dumping ground for every product.
 *
 * Resolution order for any string:
 *   1. the script's own bundle for the active language
 *   2. the script's own bundle for English
 *   3. the schema's text (already English)
 *
 * So a script works with no translations at all, and translating is purely
 * additive. lsx_lib's own locales cover only the panel's chrome - Save,
 * Discard, "Search these settings...".
 *
 * Keys are DERIVED from the setting path, so nothing needs annotating:
 *   basic.debug          -> settings.basic.debug.label / .description
 *   <group id>           -> sections.<id>.label / .description
