/**
 * Minigames — placeholder.
 *
 * PLANNED: lsx_lib already ships a `minigame` module, and gg_lib has a set of
 * thirteen (breach, codecrack, connect, hold, keymash, lockpick, memory,
 * reflex, sequence, skillcheck, timing, wordwiz) each with its own settings and
 * a live preview. The intent is to pull those across and convert them to our
 * format, then this page becomes:
 *
 *   - a list of every registered minigame
 *   - its settings, generated from the same schema walk as everything else
 *   - a PLAY button that runs the real thing in the panel, so difficulty can be
 *     tuned by feel rather than by guessing at numbers
 *
 * The section exists now so the rail and the routing are settled before the
 * games land - nothing else has to move when they do.
