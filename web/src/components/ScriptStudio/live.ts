 * changed: a setting renamed, moved into a different section, or turned from a
 * number into a list. A staged edit against the old shape would then be
 * carried forward onto a setting that no longer exists, and the panel would
 * hold a pending change nothing on screen accounts for - or worse, save it.

 * control. Everything else is dropped, and the admin is told rather than left
 * to notice the change count went down on its own.
