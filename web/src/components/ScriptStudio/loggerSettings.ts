/**
 * The logger's own settings, pulled out for the Delivery tab.
 *
 * They used to live in lsx_lib's settings rail under "Logger", which meant
 * leaving the page where you read logs to change where logs go. Delivery is
 * the page about exactly that, so it owns them - the same move already made
 * for `bridging` (Bridges page) and `access` (Admins page).
 *
 * The schema stays the source of truth. These are the SAME entries the rail
 * would have drawn, so they save through the same store, the same save bar and
 * the same history. Nothing here is a second copy of a setting.
