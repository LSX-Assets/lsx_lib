/**
 * What lsx_lib is bridged to, and whether it took.
 *
 * The page used to be entirely invented - a hand-written list of rows with a
 * hand-written registry of which resources were "running". It looked exactly
 * like the real thing, which is the worst way for a diagnostic page to be
 * wrong: the first place you look when something misbehaves was telling you
 * about a server that does not exist.
 *
 * Nothing here is a list. The rows ARE lsx_lib's own `bridging.*` settings,
 * so every option a bridge offers is the option the server actually accepts,
 * and adding a supported inventory means editing the schema and nothing else.
 * The only thing asked of the game is what no schema can know: which of those
 * resources are up, at what version, and what auto-detection picked.
