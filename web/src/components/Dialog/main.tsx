/**
 * Talking to somebody.
 *
 * NOT A PANEL. Whoever you are speaking to is on camera while this is open and
 * their face is doing half the talking, so there is no card and no scrim — a
 * gradient along the bottom with the conversation laid on it.
 *
 * NOTHING MOVES. Their line gets a fixed band whether it runs to one line or
 * four, and the replies are dealt four at a time into a 2x2 that pages rather
 * than grows — a short page keeps its empty cells. A conversation whose buttons
 * walk up the screen between reads is one you misclick.
 *
 * The one thing ALLOWED to move is an emphasised readout, because watching a
 * number change is the payoff for the line you just picked.
 *
 * ── the right-hand column ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `metadata` is whatever the caller wants it to be. A haggle puts the asking
 * price, the price on the table and the seller's mood there; a scrapyard could
 * put your rep and how full the basket is. Three flags shape a row and nothing
 * about any particular script is known here:
 *
 *   emphasis  the big one — rendered large and scale-pops when its value changes
 *   strike    struck through, for a figure that has been beaten
 *   tone      ok | warn | bad | muted, for colour
 *
 * ── who decides ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both. A dialogue whose responses carry `action` is client-driven and behaves
 * as it always has. One that declares `onSelect` is SERVER-DRIVEN: the pick
 * goes up, a whole new state comes back, and this renders it. The second is
 * what anything with money in it wants, because then nothing on this side of
 * the wire can be argued with.
