/**
 * One element, wearing the calling script's colours.
 *
 * lsx_lib draws every shared UI on ITS OWN page, so until now everything on it
 * wore lsx_lib's theme — one script's dialogue came up in lsx_lib's green
 * whatever colours that script had been given. The fix is not to repaint the
 * page, because two scripts can have something on screen at once: one
 * script's notification over another's dialogue has to be two colours at the
 * same time.
 *
 * So the scope is the ELEMENT, not the page.
 *
 * ── the CSS-variable trap ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Mantine 8 paints from CSS custom properties, and by default every provider
 * writes them to `:root`. Nesting one inside another therefore does NOT scope
 * anything — the inner provider overwrites the outer one's variables globally
 * and the LAST one mounted wins for everything on the page.
 *
 * `cssVariablesSelector` is what makes it a scope: point it at a class only
 * this subtree carries, and the variables land there instead of on the root.
 * `withCssVariables` has to stay on, or nothing is emitted for that selector at
 * all.
 *
 * Every wrapper needs its OWN selector, hence the generated class per instance —
 * two elements sharing one would fight over the same block.
