-- Runs this resource's server/shared tests. With `+c` it also runs the
-- client/shared tests on the target player (server -> client via lib.callback) —
-- that leg needs lib.test loaded on the CLIENT too, which is what declaring
-- `lsx_lib 'test'` in the consumer fxmanifest guarantees (force-loads the module
-- in both contexts; see the loader in lsx_lib/init.lua).
--
-- NOTE: the test registry is per-VM, so `lsxtest` runs the tests of the
-- resource that owns this command. Keep a suite's tests in one resource.

-- SECURITY: `lsxtest` is CONSOLE-ONLY. The `source ~= 0` guard below means only
-- the server console (the owner/admin) can ever run it — a connected player
-- cannot, no matter their permissions. It's also a `restricted` command (ace
-- command.lsxtest). So no gating convar is needed: the runner is safe to have
-- present; it simply does nothing when a resource ships no tests.

--- `lsxtest [resource] [filter] [playerId] [+c]`
---
--- ── why a resource argument, and why an event ───────────────────────────────
---
--- Every resource declaring `lsx_lib 'test'` loads this file into its OWN VM
--- and registers this command. FiveM keeps one handler per command name, so the
--- last resource to start silently took ownership of `lsxtest` and ran only
--- its own suite — with two test-carrying scripts installed, which suite you
--- got came down to restart order, and nothing said so.
---
--- So the surviving handler is a DISPATCHER. It parses the line and fires an
--- event; every VM listens and runs only if it was named. Whichever copy won
--- the registration, the run reaches all of them.
---
--- Still console-only. A suite is allowed side effects — fishing's adds and
--- removes real items to prove the inventory bridge works — so it must not be
--- reachable by a player, and `source ~= 0` is the whole of that.
--- Did any VM take the last dispatch?
---
--- Server events run their handlers INLINE, so by the time `TriggerEvent`
--- returns below, every resource that was going to answer already has. That is
--- what lets the dispatcher tell "nobody ships tests" apart from "it ran and
--- printed nothing", which are the same silence otherwise.
