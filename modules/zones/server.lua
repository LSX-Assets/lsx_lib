  --- Is this point inside a polygon?

  --- FLAT by default. A polygon is defined by x/y — it is a shape on a map —
  --- and its points routinely carry z 0 because that is what a map editor
  --- stores. The default used to be a five-metre band, which meant a point at
  --- any real world height was outside a boundary drawn at zero: every "is
  --- this inside" answered no, and nothing said why.
  ---
  --- example_fishing had already worked around it at all three of its call sites
  --- by passing `9999.0`; example_cars had not, and its drop rules and
  --- scrapyard boundaries silently refused everywhere.
  ---
  --- Pass a `height` when you genuinely mean a volume — a floor of a building,
  --- a depth band. Leaving it out means the shape, at any height.
  ---
  --- @param poly table    the ring
  --- @param pos vector3
  --- @param height number|nil  a band around the polygon's own z; omit for flat
