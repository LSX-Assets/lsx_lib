-- Position-related admin tools.
--
-- Exposes:
--   lib.adminTool.capturePosition(cb?)
--     Releases NUI focus, fades blur out, polls E (confirm) / Backspace
--     (cancel). On confirm calls cb({x,y,z,w}) and sends a NUI message
--     that resolves the React picker promise. On cancel cb(nil) and sends
--     the cancel message. cb is optional — the NUI flow works on its own.
--
--   lib.adminTool.gotoCoord({x, y, z, w})
--     Teleports the player to the given world coords. Used by the Goto
--     button next to position fields, and callable directly from Lua for
--     any admin-only "jump to coord" flow.
--
-- NUI surface (registered centrally in admin/init.lua, dispatched by id):
--   ADMIN_TOOL_BEGIN { id = 'capturePosition' }    → starts capture flow
--   ADMIN_TOOL_INVOKE { id = 'gotoCoord', value }  → teleport
--
-- React side fires SendNuiMessage events back:
--   { action = 'capturePosition_RESULT',    data = {x,y,z,w} }
--   { action = 'capturePosition_CANCELLED' }

--- Blur on or off, waiting its turn.
---
--- The blur natives IGNORE a new fade while one is still running, and the panel
--- fades in the moment it opens - so clicking Set promptly enough had the
--- fade-out silently dropped and left the world blurred for the whole walk,
--- with nothing to clear it. `openSettingsUi` already waits for exactly this
--- reason; the capture never did.
---
--- In its own thread because the entry points are NUI callbacks, which are no
--- place to sit and yield.
---
--- ── and why it re-checks before it acts ─────────────────────────────────────
---
--- A thread that waits and then blurs is a thread that can blur AFTER the thing
--- it was blurring for has gone. Close the panel while this is still waiting on
--- a fade already in flight, and the fade-in lands on an empty screen with
--- nothing left open to clear it - the world stays blurred until you restart.
--- Which is worse than the bug it was added to fix.
---
--- So the fade-in only happens if we are still the reason for it. `still` is
--- checked at the moment of acting, not the moment of asking.
