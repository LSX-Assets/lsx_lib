-- Placing a PROP, rather than standing somewhere.
--
-- Sibling of tools/position.lua, and deliberately the same shape: release NUI
-- focus, drop the blur, show an instruction card, poll for confirm/cancel, hand
-- the answer back to the React picker through a SendNuiMessage the promise is
-- waiting on. Anything learned there applies here.
--
-- ── why not lib.placeEntity ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- lsx_lib already has two of these. `lib.placeEntity` aims from the camera and
-- drops; `lib.positionEntity` drags gizmo handles. Both are console-command
-- tools written for a developer with a clipboard — placeEntity literally copies
-- a Lua snippet to your clipboard and returns, which is the opposite of what a
-- settings field wants. Neither knows about the admin-tool router, the blur,
-- the instruction card, or answering a React promise.
--
-- So this is the third, and it is the one Script Studio uses.
--
-- ── two modes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- ROUGH is where you start: the prop follows your crosshair onto whatever you
-- are looking at, and the arrows turn and tilt it. Getting a thing roughly
-- where it goes is a pointing problem, and pointing is what a mouse is for.
--
-- PRECISE (G) hands the same prop to `lib.gizmo`. It stops following you and
-- sits still with handles on it, camera free to orbit, so the last few
-- centimetres are dragged rather than aimed. Confirming there finishes the
-- placement; cancelling there comes back to rough with the position intact.
--
-- The split exists because one interaction cannot do both. A prop that
-- follows your eyes can never be nudged a centimetre, and a gizmo is a
-- miserable way to cross a car park.
--
-- ── what it does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- It does not tilt the prop to match the surface you are pointing at. A laptop
-- on a desk, a radio on a shelf, a box on a floor - all flat, all the common
-- case - and the pitch nudges plus the gizmo cover a slope. Deriving a
-- rotation from a surface normal is easy to write and hard to get right, and
-- wrong rotation maths reads as "the tool is broken" rather than "that
-- surface is odd".
--
-- NUI surface (dispatched by id from admin/init.lua):
--   ADMIN_TOOL_BEGIN { id = 'captureObject', model, value?,
--                      instructions?, preciseInstructions? }
--
-- Answers with:
--   { action = 'captureObject_RESULT', data = { x, y, z, w, rx, ry, rz } }

--- Enter places, Esc cancels, G swaps mode — the same three keys doing the

---
--- Esc is POLLED, not key-mapped: the pause menu owns it and takes the press
--- first, so `RegisterKeyMapping` can never have it. Disabling the control and

--- Backspace is the one on the card; Esc is taken as well, silently, because
--- it is what half of people press first and refusing it teaches nothing.
