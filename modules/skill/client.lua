-- PUSHED, never fetched. Framework client-side metadata does not reliably
-- refresh — QBX in particular keeps a stale copy — so asking it is how fishing
-- ended up showing a level that was minutes out of date. The server tells us
-- on every write, and this holds the answer.
--
-- Nothing here reaches the server. Opening a UI that shows a level must not
-- cost a round trip, so a value that has never been pushed reads as zero and
