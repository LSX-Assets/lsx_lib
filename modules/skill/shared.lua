-- lib.skill — XP, levels and progress, once.
--
-- ── why ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The curve was written FIVE times: fishing's `src/shared/skill.lua`, a second
-- one in its server that is a DIFFERENT formula, two hand copies in its admin
-- React, and `createSkill` in dirk-cfx-react. The two Lua ones disagree — at
-- 8,134 XP fishing's gates say level 24 and its own `getLevel` export says 99.
-- That is what happens to arithmetic nobody owns.
--
-- This module owns it. The formula here is the RuneScape curve fishing's SHARED
-- file uses — the one every gate and every bar in the game is already drawn
-- from — and `createSkill` in cfx-react is a line-for-line port of the same
-- thing, so the number the player sees and the number the server gates on come
-- out of the same maths.
--
-- ── one skill, or one skill each ────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A skill is one thing you can be good at. Some are SINGLE — there is one
-- fishing level and you either have it or you do not. Others are INSTANCED:
-- the same skill, the same curve, held separately against each of several
-- things.
--
--   lib.skill.register('fishing', { baseXP = 83, maxLevel = 99 })
--   lib.skill.register('yardRep', { baseXP = 40, maxLevel = 10, instanced = true })
--
-- Reputation is the second kind, and getting that wrong is what would have
-- made this a copy of fishing instead of a rewrite. It is NOT one skill called
-- "yard rep" — it is one definition with an instance per yard, because you are
-- somebody to one man and nobody to the next. So an instanced skill stores a
-- map rather than a number, and every call names the instance alongside the
-- player. Fishing, by contrast, has exactly one level, hardcoded to the
-- metadata key `fishingXp` in fifteen places.
--
-- Level is DERIVED, never stored. Change the curve in the panel and everyone's
-- level moves with it, which is the correct answer and impossible if a number
-- was written down at the time.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- The module's own table. `modules/<name>/shared.lua` is CONCATENATED with the
-- context file and the chunk's return value becomes `lib.skill`, so the table
-- has to exist as a local here and be returned at the bottom of client.lua /
-- server.lua. Writing to `lib.skill` from inside would be writing to a key
-- that does not exist yet.

  baseLevel = 1,

  --- XP to reach level 2. Every later step scales off it.
  baseXP    = 83,
  --- Multiplies the requirement, so HIGHER IS SLOWER. Named the way fishing's
  --- schema describes it, which is the opposite of what the panel's
  --- `progression` meter currently implies — see the note on that control.

  --- The default stays what every existing LSX level was earned against.

--- The SHAPES a ladder can have.
---
--- Each returns the cumulative XP needed to BE `level`. They differ only in how
--- fast the cost grows, and that difference is the whole feel of a skill:
---
---   runescape  Early levels fly past, the last few are a project. What every
---              LSX level ever earned was earned against, so it stays the
---              default and stays first.
---   linear     Every level costs the same. Honest and predictable; goes flat
---              and dull at the top, because level 40 is no more of an
---              achievement than level 4.
---   quadratic  Cost grows with the square. The middle ground most RPGs use -
---              a real climb without a cliff.
---   softcap    Steep early, flattening near the ceiling, so the top stays
---              reachable. For a ladder people are meant to FINISH.
---
--- `modifier` scales all of them the same way: higher is slower.
---
--- Whichever is chosen, the XP a player holds is untouched. Level is derived,
--- never stored, so switching shape re-reads everyone against the new ladder
--- rather than taking anything away.
