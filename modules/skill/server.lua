-- lib.skill, server half — where the XP actually lives.
--
-- Stored in framework player metadata, under a key namespaced by the owning
-- resource. A stock QBX install already has `craftingrep`, `jobrep`,
-- `dealerrep` and `attachmentcraftingrep` in there, so an unprefixed name is a
-- collision with somebody else's script, and the loser fails silently.
--
--   uninstanced skill -> metadata['example_fishing_fishing']      = 4200
--   instanced skill   -> metadata['example_cars_yardRep']  = { yard_lsia = 4200 }
--
-- ── the two things fishing got wrong that this fixes ────────────────────────
--
-- 1. THREE grant sites there write metadata directly instead of going through
--    the add function, so they never fire the sync event and the player's own
--    client shows a stale level until they relog. Here there is one write path
--    and it always syncs.
--
-- 2. There is no level-up hook at all. Fishing's celebration is the NUI
--    diffing before against after and inferring one, in two components, each
--    with its own copy of the animation. `add` returns whether a threshold was
--    crossed and fires an event, so the party is the caller's decision and
--    nobody has to guess.
