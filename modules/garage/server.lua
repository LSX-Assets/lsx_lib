-- lib.garage — vehicle-storage abstraction.
--
-- Any script stores a completed / purchased vehicle with ONE call and lsx_lib
-- routes it to the right place:
--   garage-system bridge (own storage / quirks)  →  framework bridge
-- The framework bridge does a SCHEMA-AWARE insert into the framework's own
-- vehicle table (owned_vehicles / player_vehicles) or the framework's native
-- vehicle API — so it works for every garage that reads the framework table
-- (jg-advancedgarages, qb-garages, cd_garage, okokGarage, renewed…) without a
-- dedicated bridge. Garages with their OWN storage (e.g. wasabi) get a
-- bridge/garage/<resource>/server.lua that implements addVehicle and wins.
--
-- Motivating bug: example_cars hard-coded `INSERT INTO owned_vehicles
-- (owner, plate, vehicle, garage)`, which died with "Unknown column 'garage'"
-- on ESX + jg-advancedgarages (no `garage` column). The schema-aware framework
-- insert below only writes columns that actually exist.
