-- Which colours each resource wears.
--
-- lsx_lib draws every shared UI on ITS OWN page, inside its own provider. So
-- until now everything on it wore lsx_lib's theme: a dialogue opened by a
-- resource with its own palette came up in lsx_lib's green regardless.
--
-- The fix is not to repaint the page. Two resources can have something on
-- screen at the same time — a fishing notification over an example_cars
-- dialogue — so the theme belongs to the ELEMENT, not the page. Every shared
-- element ships the calling resource's theme with its payload and the
-- component scopes itself to it.
--
-- ── how it gets here ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Pushed, never fetched. `modules/scriptConfig/client.lua` runs inside every
-- CONSUMER's VM, so it is the only code that ever sees another resource's
-- config; it calls `registerTheme` whenever that config is applied. That covers
-- the first hydration and every later edit through the panel, so this map is
-- always current without a callback, a poll, or anything on the hot path.
--
-- A resource with no `theme` block never registers, so it has no entry and
-- falls back to lsx_lib's global appearance. That is what every resource does
-- today, so nothing changes for them.

end

--- The theme a given resource's UI should be drawn in, or nil for lsx_lib's.
---
--- `useOverride` off is the same answer as no theme at all: the resource has a
--- block but has chosen not to use it, so it takes the global appearance like
--- everything else.

end

--- The theme to ship with a UI payload, for whoever is calling right now.
---
--- Every shared element sends this. It has to be resolved AT SEND TIME rather
--- than when the element was registered, so an admin changing a theme while
--- something is on screen is reflected on its next update.
---
--- Call it from the entry point itself — `GetInvokingResource` only answers for
--- the frame that crossed the export boundary, so passing it down through a
--- helper first would lose it.
---
--- @param resource string|nil  usually GetInvokingResource() or GetCurrentResourceName()
