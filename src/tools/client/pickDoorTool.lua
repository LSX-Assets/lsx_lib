-- Pick-door admin tool — lsx_lib-owned.
--
-- Lives in src/tools so it loads once in lsx_lib's own VM, not in
-- every consumer that pulls lsx_lib 'scriptConfig'. Critical reasons
-- to keep this here and NOT under modules/scriptConfig/admin/tools:
--
--   1. The picker calls lib.showInstructions / DrawSphere / etc. These
--      render the SAME way regardless of which VM they're called from,
--      but the consumer's NUI iframe (when running in the consumer's VM)
--      was compositing on top of immediate-mode draws — leaving the
--      sphere invisible. Running from lsx_lib's VM matches the /pickDoor
--      slash command's render path exactly.
--
--   2. Locale strings can live in one place (lsx_lib en.json) instead
--      of every consumer needing to mirror every LSX locale key. The
--      picker prompt text is fixed across all uses anyway.
--
-- React side fires the existing ADMIN_TOOL_BEGIN NUI callback in its own
-- consumer resource; modules/scriptConfig/admin/init.lua forwards that
-- to us via the `lsx_lib:adminTool:pickDoor:begin` event. When we're
-- done we fire `lsx_lib:adminTool:pickDoor:result` carrying the picker
-- output + the originating resource name, and the same init.lua
-- SendNuiMessages back into the consumer's NUI so the React promise
-- resolver settles cleanly.

  -- NUI focus is the consumer's problem (per-resource native). The
  -- consumer's forwarder in modules/scriptConfig/admin/init.lua
  -- releases focus before triggering this event and regrabs on result.

  -- Cancel the picker if the consumer that triggered it restarts
  -- mid-flow. Without this the picker would block forever waiting for
  -- input that can never come (the React side that was awaiting the
  -- result is gone). Removed after the pick completes so we don't leak
  -- handlers across runs.
