--- vehicle list came back empty on a server with 900+ vehicles. One copy here,
--- required by both bootstraps, is the fix.
---
--- Client-only, and only worth registering for a resource that actually has a
--- ui_page. The caller checks both.

--- Every vehicle the framework knows, as a flat list.
---
--- Asked of the framework bridge first, so per-framework knowledge stays in
--- `bridge/framework/<name>/shared.lua`. `lib.FW.Shared.Vehicles` is the
--- fallback for a bridge that has not been taught this yet — it works for
--- anything QB-shaped, and is simply absent on ESX.

  --
  -- Required rather than reimplemented. lsx_lib boots from `src/init.lua` and

  --- Ask the OWNING SCRIPT something, from inside its own Studio page.
  ---
  --- A page supplied by example_fishing renders inside lsx_lib's NUI frame, so
  --- `fetchNui` posts to lsx_lib - not to fishing. Fishing's own callbacks are
  --- simply never reached, and because fetchNui falls back to its mock data on
  --- a failed fetch, the page showed invented players and said nothing.
  ---
  --- So the request comes here and is forwarded to the server callback the page
  --- names. Two things keep that honest:
  ---
  ---  * the callback name MUST start with `<resource>:`, so a page can only
  ---    ever reach the script that supplied it;
  ---  * the answering script does its own permission check, exactly as it did
  ---    when its own panel asked - nothing here grants access.
  --- What the Bridges page cannot read out of a schema.
  ---
  --- The OPTIONS for every bridge are already in lsx_lib's own schema - each
  --- setting's enum is the list of things it can be - so the page builds the
  --- rows from settings it already has. What no schema can say is what this
  --- particular server is running, and that is all this answers:
  ---
  ---   * which resources are actually up, and at what version;
  ---   * what auto-detection picked, for a setting left on "auto";
  ---   * the fixed facts from the manifest - server build, OneSync, oxmysql.
  ---
  --- The resource NAMES come from the caller rather than a list kept here, so
  --- adding a supported inventory means editing the schema and nothing else.
  --- A list in two places is a list that disagrees with itself.
  --- Discord channels the bot can see, for the redirect picker.
