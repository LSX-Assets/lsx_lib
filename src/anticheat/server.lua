-- Anti-cheats that filter events can drop lsx_lib's callbacks before the
-- server sees them. The script then looks broken - shops missing, zones
-- invisible, players on the wrong language - and reinstalling fixes nothing,
-- because nothing in the script is at fault. It cost one customer two weeks
-- and three reinstalls before anyone asked what anti-cheat he ran.
--
-- Two halves. This one names a known anti-cheat at boot so the admin has read
-- the word "whitelist" before the first ticket. The client half proves the
-- actual symptom - a request that gets no answer - regardless of name.
