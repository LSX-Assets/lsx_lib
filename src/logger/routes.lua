-- `lsx_logs`, which is what the panel reads; a route is an extra destination
-- for the subset someone wants to see in a channel.
--
-- This replaces the per-script version of the same idea. Every script used to
-- carry its own webhook URL and its own list of event toggles, which meant the
-- same feature written N times, configured N times, and rate-limited N times -
-- each script cheerfully firing its own POSTs at Discord with no idea the
-- others existed.
--
-- The part that actually needed care is the sending. Discord's webhook limits
-- are per URL and unforgiving, and a busy night's fishing is not a trickle: it
-- is fifty catches in a few seconds. So nothing is posted immediately. Each
-- webhook has one queue, one in-flight request, and up to ten embeds per
-- message - which is Discord's own maximum, and turns that fifty into five
-- posts rather than fifty.
