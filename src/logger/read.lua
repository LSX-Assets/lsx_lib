-- Reading the log table back, for the Logs page.
--
-- Every query here is written to be answerable from an index. The shapes that
-- matter:
--
--   * paging is KEYSET - `WHERE id < ? ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT n`. An OFFSET
--     scan re-reads everything before the page it returns, so page forty costs
--     forty pages of work; keyset costs one, forever.
--   * every filter is paired with `id` in an index, so filtering and ordering
--     are the same walk rather than a filter followed by a sort.
--   * free text over `message` is the one thing no index can help with, so it
--     is only ever applied on top of a bounded window - never on its own.
--
-- Read access is the same permission that opens the panel. Logs name players
-- and carry whatever a script put in them; they are not less sensitive than
-- the settings next to them.
