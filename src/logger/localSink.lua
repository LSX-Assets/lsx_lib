-- The log line kept HERE, so the panel has something to show.
--
-- lib.logger only ever shipped OUT - Datadog, Loki, Fivemanage. That is the
-- right answer for a server that runs one of those, and no answer at all for
-- everyone else: the Logs page had nothing to read, which is why it was mock
-- data pretending to be a server.
--
-- So there is a local sink. It is deliberately modest:
--
--   * OFF by default. A table that fills up on a server nobody asked is worse
--     than no page at all.
--   * Written from the emit path's own buffer, as ONE multi-row INSERT every
--     half second. A query per log line is how a busy server's fishing spree
--     turns into a thousand round trips a minute.
--   * Read by keyset (`WHERE id < cursor`), never OFFSET. Page 40 of an offset
--     scan reads the thirty-nine before it every time.
--   * Pruned on a timer, in chunks, so retention never holds the thread.
