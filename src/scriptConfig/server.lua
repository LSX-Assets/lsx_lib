-- Scans every started resource for the `lsx_lib 'scriptConfig'` metadata tag,

-- invoking admin. Selecting a resource fires `<resourceName>:openScriptConfig`,
-- which the injected scriptConfig client module handles inside that resource.
--
-- Access model:
--   • Master group lives in `lsx_lib_master_group` server convar (default
--     `group.admin`). Anyone with that ACE permission can always edit
--     anything. Convar > config so a bad save can't lock you out.
--   • `scriptConfig.overrides` (in lsx_lib's own scriptConfig) grants extra
--     access to non-master ACE groups or specific player identifiers per
--     resource. Purely additive — overrides cannot remove master access.

-- server.cfgs grant to admins:
--   • `group.admin`  — principal membership (works when the cfg has
--                      `add_ace group.admin group.admin allow`)
--   • `admin`        — bare permission (works when the cfg has
--                      `add_ace group.admin admin allow`)
-- `command` is deliberately NOT in the default: admins already inherit it
-- via group.admin, and it's the one token an operator might grant to a
-- non-admin — including it would silently widen master access.
-- A server owner who locks down one of these can override via the

-- schema.json, which is deliberately not in files{} either. So "what changed
-- in the version I am running" needs no endpoint and no network: it is sitting
-- in the resource folder, and it is the changelog for the exact build
-- installed rather than whatever is newest.
--
-- Capped because this is going over the NUI bridge. Fishing's is already 578
-- lines and only the recent entries are ever read.

-- page should show what happened last time rather than an empty screen and a
-- button, and certainly rather than firing a run just because someone looked.

-- The lock and the cache live HERE, in lsx_lib, because the runs live in
-- every consumer: one place that knows about all of them.
