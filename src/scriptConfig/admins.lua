-- Who can open Script Studio, beyond the master group.
--
-- Access used to be two things: the `lsx_lib_master_group` convar, and each
-- script's own access block in its schema. Both are files - so granting a
-- moderator access meant editing a schema and restarting, and there was no way
-- to say "look, don't touch".
--
-- This is the third source: rows a master adds from the panel.
--
-- IN ITS OWN TABLE, not in scriptConfig. Storing the access list in the thing
-- the access list guards is circular - a bad write locks everyone out of the
-- panel that would fix it. A separate table also means the master convar is
-- always a way back in, whatever is in here.
--
-- A row names either a player (identifier) or an ACE principal (group.mod), so
-- servers that already run ACE groups can grant a whole group at once, and
-- servers that do not can name people directly.
